# ðŸŽ² Dice Game 

## Overview

Welcome to **Dice Game**! This simple web-based game allows two players to roll dice by refreshing the page, and the game will automatically declare a winner based on the dice values. The interface is clean and minimal, featuring two dice (one for each player) and a title inviting users to "Refresh Me" to get a new roll.

## Features

- **Two-player dice rolling**: Each player has their own dice.
- **Randomized dice values**: Dice values are randomized on each page refresh.
- **Winner announcement**: The game automatically compares the dice values and announces whether Player 1, Player 2 wins, or if itâ€™s a tie.
- **Simple UI**: The interface includes a clear title ("Refresh Me") and dice display for both players.

## How it Works

1. **Page Setup**: The webpage displays a title and two dice, one for Player 1 and another for Player 2.
2. **Random Dice Roll**: Each time the page is refreshed, a new random number between 1 and 6 is assigned to both Player 1 and Player 2 dice.
3. **Announcing the Winner**: After rolling, the game checks the dice values:
   - If Player 1's dice is higher, Player 1 wins.
   - If Player 2's dice is higher, Player 2 wins.
   - If both dice show the same value, itâ€™s declared a tie.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling the layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for randomizing dice rolls and determining the winner.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Simply refresh the page to roll the dice for both players.
3. Check the results and see who wins!
